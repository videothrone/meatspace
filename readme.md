# Meatspace

"Meatspace" is a cheeky social network for space travelers done during my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). The project was done in about 2 1/2 weeks and grew organically to and extent. F.e. Redux was learned and used during a later stage.
